# Data-Science 

I did a Course that was focused in learning the theory and technical considerations for the construction of Machine Learning models that solve real problems in various industries in a predictive way. We use the Python programming language to build computer programs that learn from experience and support decision-making in the financial, sports and commercial sectors.
That was my inspiration to start doing projects, analyze diferents industries and create Machine Learning models to predict diferents targets.
